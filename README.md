Liszt is a simple and distraction-free tool for creating and managing lists.
Intended as a replacement for Trello, you can set due dates, attach info to cards, and even automate tasks at the push of a button.
GUI is made with Qt using Pyside2 and all data is stored in a single Sqlite3 db file.

To run, just type
```
python3 main.py
```
